HORISEON Refactor Project
-------------------------

This project is intended to take an website's existing code and re-factor it to align with currently accepted standards of layout and syntax. 

In addition to streamlining the formatting of the HTML and CSS documents, we will be improving the HTML elements to more accurately reflect their contents.

Finally, and possibly most importantly, we will be transforming the website's accessibility to  disabled users by ensuring that screen readers can correctly interpret the code and portray the intended message. Our refactoring will also aid mobile device users, by ensuring that the layout of the website is responsive to various screen sizes.
