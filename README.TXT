HORISEON Refactor Project
-------------------------

This project is intended to take an website's existing code and re-factor it to align with currently accepted standards of layout and syntax. 

In addition to streamlining the formatting of the HTML and CSS documents, we will be improving the HTML elements to more accurately reflect their contents.

Finally, and possibly most importantly, we will be transforming the website's accessibility to  disabled users by ensuring that screen readers can correctly interpret the code and portray the intended message. Our refactoring will also aid mobile device users, by ensuring that the layout of the website is responsive to various screen sizes.

----------------------

I started this project by taking a cursory look at the HTML document to search for glaring errors. Then, I started slowly reading line by line to see what improvements could be made to meet our success criteria, and taking notes. I fixed a broken <nav> link by adding an "id". I noted that a large majority of elements were assigned <div>, and nested within <div> -- while technically usable, this is not indicative of what is contained therein, nor helpful to future developers. Per instructions, I started changing these generic HTML elements to semantic elements, and entering <!----> notes to indicate my improvements. Doing so required a fair amount of reading on the correct usage of the semantic elements, where I believe I mostly succeeded.

I then proceeded to read, edit, and add to the linked CSS stylesheet. This process also involved many hours of reading across dozens of open browser tabs. My quickest improvements were to consolidate the many unnecessarily repetitious selectors of images, and classes. I struggled the most with putting to use our new flexbox and wrapping skills, and used a lot of trial and error to make the sidebar do *mostly* what I wanted. Overall, I believe I made significant improvements to the webpage's functionality, layout, and accessibility to both disabled and mobile device users.

A great resource has been to re-read our class documents, and my most used online resource has been w3schools' tutorials. I find this site easiest to navigate and find the answers I need.
